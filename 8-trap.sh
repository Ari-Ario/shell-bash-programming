#there are several ways to use trap command

#General syntax given from terminal: trap command signals

#processing code to be traped from another terminal
echo "pid of current processing code is: $$"

#for example trap SIGINT everytime by: ctrl+c
trap "echo "Exit caought"" SIGINT

for (( i=0; i<=10; i++ ))
do
    echo $i
    # numbers will be printed every 2 seconds to be able to trap script
