#first (above) line is obligatory, that refers to shell directory /bin/bash

#printing a simple text:
echo "text for test"
#execute file just by writing ./filename. But the file must have execution mod:; write in terminal: chmod +x filename, then ./filename

#reading an input from user:
echo "enter text, signs or numbers:"
read input
echo "your input is: $input"
#reading user-input on the same line:
echo -e "enter sth: \c"
read sth
echo "you input is: $sth"

#Arithmetic calculations:
#First for decimal numbers:
echo "first method of operations on decimal: $( expr 5 + 11 )"
#or
echo "second method for arithmetic operations: $(( 5 + 11 ))"
#The same for all others except multiplication, which needs an extrta \*
echo "$( expr 5 - 11 )"
echo "$(( 5 - 11 ))"
echo "$( expr 5 \* 11 )"
echo "$(( 5 * 11 ))"
echo "$( expr 11 / 5 )"
echo "$(( 11 / 5 ))"
echo "$( expr 11 % 5 )"
echo "$(( 11 % 5 ))" #remainder

#Arithmetic operations for float
echo " 1.2 + 2.3 " | bc
echo " 2.3 - 1.2 " | bc
echo " 1.2 * 2.3 " | bc
echo " 2.3 / 1.2 " | bc

#Arithmetic operations are the same with variables; for example:
echo -e "enter first number: \c"
read num1
echo -e "enter second number: \c"
read num2
echo "scale=2; $num1 / $num2" | bc -l #scale gives the number of floats back
