#until-loop is the revers form of while loop, therefore we write the same code-example of while-loop in until-loop

#symple syntax
num=1
until [ $num -ge 5 ] # or (( $num > 5 ))
do
	echo $num
    #pre-encrementation diffrent from post-encrementation of while-loop example
    (( ++num ))
done

#more complex example of opening terminal multiple times; the same as while-loop

echo $num #it is incremented to 5
until (( $num > 10 ))
do
	echo $num
    (( num++ ))
